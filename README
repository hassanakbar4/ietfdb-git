In order to test the datatracker facelift, you need to add this to
settings_local.py:

# Override directory for Bootstrap'ed templates
import os
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    BASE_DIR + "/templates_bootstrap",
    BASE_DIR + "/templates",
    BASE_DIR + "/secr/templates",
)
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR + "/../static_bootstrap/"

You also need to add 'widget_tweaks' to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py -
have not found a way to add this in settings_local.py. And you need to
install it; see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-widget-tweaks

The goal here is: *** NO CHANGES TO THE PYTHON CODE ***

Whenever changes to the python code are made, they can only fix HTML bugs,
or add comments (tagged with "FACELIFT") about functionality that can be
removed once the facelift templates become default.
