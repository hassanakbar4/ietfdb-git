This is the "facelift" datatracker branch that uses Twitter Bootstrap for
the UI.

You need to install django-widget-tweaks and django-crispy-forms, too:
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-widget-tweaks
	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-crispy-forms

The meta goal of this effort is: *** NO CHANGES TO THE PYTHON CODE ***

Whenever changes to the python code are made, they can only fix HTML bugs,
or add comments (tagged with "FACELIFT") about functionality that can be
removed once the facelift templates become default. Or they need to add
functionality that is only called from the new facelift templates.

Javascript that is only used on one template goes into that template.
Javascript that is used by more than one template goes into ietf.js.

All CSS goes into ietf.css. No CSS in the templates or - god forbid -
style tags! (And no CSS or HTML styling in python code!!)
