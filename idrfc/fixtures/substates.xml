        <field type="TextField" name="description">IESG discussions on the document have raised some issues that need
to be brought to the attention of the authors/WG, but those issues
have not been written down yet. (It is common for discussions during
a telechat to result in such situations. An AD may raise a possible
issue during a telechat and only decide as a result of that
discussion whether the issue is worth formally writing up and
bringing to the attention of the authors/WG).  A document stays in
the "Point Raised - Writeup Needed" state until *ALL* IESG comments
that have been raised have been documented.</field>

    <object pk="2" model="idtracker.idsubstate">
        <field type="CharField" name="sub_state">AD Followup</field>
        <field type="TextField" name="description">A generic substate indicating that the shepherding AD has the action
item to determine appropriate next steps. In particular, the
appropriate steps (and the corresponding next state or substate)
depend entirely on the nature of the issues that were raised and can
only be decided with active involvement of the shepherding AD.
Examples include:

    - if another AD raises an issue, the shepherding AD may first
      iterate with the other AD to get a better understanding of the
      exact issue. Or, the shepherding AD may attempt to argue that
      the issue is not serious enough to bring to the attention of the
      authors/WG.

    - if a documented issue is forwarded to a WG, some further
      iteration may be needed before it can be determined whether a
      new revision is needed or whether the WG response to an issue
      clarifies the issue sufficiently.

    - when a new revision appears, the shepherding AD will first look
      at the changes to determine whether they believe all outstanding
      issues have been raised satisfactorily, prior to asking the ADs
      who raised the original issues to verify the changes.
