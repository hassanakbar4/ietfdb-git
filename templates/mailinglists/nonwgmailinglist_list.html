<center><h2>IETF Non-WG Mailing Lists</h2></center>

<p>This page attempts to list all the active, publicly visible lists that are
considered to be related to the IETF, but are not the main list of any working
group, in alphabetical order by list name.</p>

<p>It includes lists that are for discussion of particular topics, lists
that have belonged to former working groups but are still active, lists that
are specified in the registration rules of some parameter registry as
"for review," and others of less clear classification.</p>

<p>Mail sent to all these lists is considered an IETF "Contribution"
as defined in RFC 5378, Section 1 (see also the <a href="http://www.ietf.org/about/note-well.html">NOTE WELL</a> statement).</p>

<p>Details of adding lists to this page can be found at the bottom of the
page.</p>

  <li>IRTF Research Groups (listed at <a 
  href="http://www.irtf.org/">http://www.irtf.org/</a>) 
  <li>Lists of former WGs where the list is expected to go passive after WG 
  shutdown (these can also be found at <a href="http://www.ietf.org/wg/concluded/index.html">http://www.ietf.org/wg/concluded/index.html</a>)
  <li>Closed lists where normal IETF participants should have no reason to want
